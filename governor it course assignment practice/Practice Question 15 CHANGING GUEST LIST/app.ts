// Question 15. CHANGING GUEST LIST. You just heard that one of your guests can't make the dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You'll have to think of someone else to invite.
// . Start with your program from exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program
// stating the name of the guest who can't make it.

// . Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can't make it.

// . Print a second set of invitation messages, one  for each person who is still in your list.

let GuestList = ["Muhammad", "Ali", "Asghar"];
console.log(`hi ${GuestList[1]} please join us at 9 pm for dinner.`)
console.log(`hi my friend ${GuestList[2]} i m inviting you to dinner at my home`)
console.log(`hi ${GuestList[0]} please come to my place for dinner tonight.`)

console.log(`unfortunately, ${GuestList[1]} and ${GuestList[2]} can't coming today`)

// old list of guests.. "Muhammad", "Ali", "Asghar"
// modifying GuestList...

GuestList = ["Muhammad", "Hanzala", "Abbas"];
console.log(`hi my friend ${GuestList[0]} please join us at 9 pm for dinner.`)
console.log(`hi ${GuestList[1]} i m inviting you to dinner at my home`)
console.log(`hi ${GuestList[2]} please come to my place for dinner tonight.`)
