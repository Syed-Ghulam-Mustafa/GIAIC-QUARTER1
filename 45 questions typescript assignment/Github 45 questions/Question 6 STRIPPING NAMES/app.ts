// Question 6. STRIPPING NAMES. Store a person's name, and include some whitespaces characters at the beginning and 
// end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", atleast once. Print the name once,


// so the whitespaces around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the whitespaces.
let personName: string = "\tAzhar\n";

let my_name: string = "Uzair\n";

let FirstName = "\tSyed";

console.log(FirstName)

console.log(my_name)

console.log(personName)

console.log(personName.trim())
